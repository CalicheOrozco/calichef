Pinch seam of roll with your fingers to seal. Elongate roll into a baguette shape, rolling back and forth exerting gentle pressure from the middle of the baguette to its ends. Place baguettes seam-side down on baking paper, pulling up paper between baguettes to create a low wall.

Cover baguettes loosely with cling film or a damp tea towel and allow to rise for a further 45 minutes.",

Slide baguettes, together with baking paper, onto the top preheated baking tray. Quickly but also carefully splash the hot water on the lower baking tray to create steam and immediately close oven door to trap the steam. Bake for 20 minutes (250\u00b0C), or until dark golden brown. If baguettes seem quite brown before end of baking time, reduce oven temperature to 230\u00b0C. Allow baguettes to cool for 20 minutes before slicing."

After cleaning, allow the stoneware to dry out completely in a place that is well-ventilated, both from above and from below; only store once completely dry.",

Feel free to use a normal orange jam or marmalade with the extra lemon juice if you can't find a Seville variety. Marinating and steaming the duck makes it beautifully tender, and if you'd like to serve 4 and share the enjoyment, see our doubling tip.",
            "Potatoes must be cooked through and tender before mashing to create a creamy mash that is lump-free and not gluey. In step 4, cook potatoes 5-10 minutes longer if needed - cooking time depends on potato variety.",
            "If you buy duck breasts with skin, they should be approx. 225-300 g each. Peel off skin and fat with the help of a small sharp knife before marinating duck.",
            "Duck breasts can be marinated for up to 24 hours before steaming. In step 2, place duck and marinade in a sealed bag or covered container and refrigerate. When ready to cook, transfer duck and marinade to lined Varoma tray and continue with recipe.",
            "Replace green beans with vegetables of your choice in step 6, for instance thinly sliced carrots, halved Brussels sprouts, shredded savoy cabbage, sliced red peppers or pak choi. Place the vegetables that require the longest steaming time in the simmering basket first.",

            "For best results we recommend using Valrhona or other couverture chocolate. The recipes will work with other chocolates but the results may be different. Valrhona is a high-quality couverture chocolate. Couverture is the name given to a certain class of high-quality chocolate. Couverture chocolate, unlike regular chocolate, is ground to a finer texture during the production process and contains a greater percentage of cocoa butter relative to the other ingredients. These two differences produce a superior flavour and texture that makes couverture the preferred chocolate for tempering and enrobing truffles, bonbons, and other fine candies.",

Prairie bison were extirpated from Canada by 1888 and the wood bison were almost extinct by the 1850s due to heavy hunting. Preservation efforts began in the mid 19th century and currently we have 20,000 bison preserved in their native environment via Parks Canada with many more raised commercially, thus the bison burger has become an iconic Canadian prairie recipe.",

After cleaning, allow the stoneware to dry out completely in a place that is well-ventilated, both from above and from below; only store once completely dry.",

            "The \"traditional Acadian salted herbs\" varies from the Quebecois version as it contains only brined bulbs and green stems from the onion family. The origin of salted herbs in Quebec dates back to the deportation of the Acadians in the second half of the 18th century; many Acadians settled in Quebec where salted herbs quickly became part of the culinary tradition. This ancestral method of preservation keeps the delicious aromas of fresh herbs harvested during the summer throughout the winter months and still used in modern Quebecois kitchens today.",
            "To prepare jars, place 500 g water into mixing bowl. Place jars and lids upside down in center of the Varoma, secure Varoma lid and steam 20 min/Varoma/speed 1. Leave to drain - do not dry or touch the inside surfaces. Alternatively, clean jars and lids thoroughly in hot soapy water. Rinse by pouring boiling water over them, then put the clean jars and lids in a baking dish and heat 15 minutes in the oven (100\u00b0C / 212\u00b0F). Let cool until ready to fill.",
            "Mixing bowl must be clean and completely dry before chopping herbs.",
            "This recipe has a traditional salted herb flavour, however any assorted herbs and greens can be used to achieve different flavour profiles, e.g. rosemary, beet leaves, chard, radish leaves, garlic flower, etc, cut into pieces (3 cm).",
            "Fresh herbs are required for this recipe as dried herbs will not release their flavours and aromas in the salt.",
            "Three bunches of parsley are approximately 100 g, bottom stems trimmed.",
            "The ratio of salt to herbs required is 1:3 which enables preservation and must not be altered.",
            "We recommend using coarse salt, ideally from Gu\u00e9rande, but Kosher salt or pickling salt can be used.",
            "Salted herbs have a fine minced texture. Store in the refrigerator as they cannot be frozen.",
            "Use in small quantities to season and salt dishes. Salted herbs are a traditional addition to soups and add a flavourful zest to eggs, salad dressings, mashed potatoes, rice, fish and meat casseroles, etc. and are a great way to preserve garden herbs year-round."

            "Saskatoon is a Cree word for the sweet, fleshy berries that were a primary food source for Aboriginal people and early settlers on the Canadian prairies. Saskatoon berries resemble blueberries in size as well as colour but they are discernably different in flavour from one another. The Saskatoon berry has a much more intense flavour and when baked or in a jam may present an almond note. These delicious berries grow from western Ontario to British Columbia and the Yukon and are beloved by Canadians where family foraging stories are abundant during Saskatoon berry season. These have become available commercially only the past 20 years due to their diminishing availability in the wild. Saskatoon berry pies and Saskatoon berry jam have been farmhouse favourites for generations. A jar of Saskatoon berry jam is a sought after tourist purchase!",
            "If using frozen Saskatoon berries, check thickness after 30 minute point and if necessary, place Varoma dish (dish only, no lid) onto mixing bowl lid and cook a further 5 min/Varoma/\ue003/speed 1. When ready, ingredients will be thick, but still loose. As the jam cools, it will thicken considerably yet this will remain a loose jar.",
            "To prepare jars, place 500 g water in mixing bowl. Place jars, seals and lids upside down in center of the Varoma, secure Varoma lid and steam 20 min/Varoma/speed 1. Leave to drain - do not dry or touch the inside surfaces. Alternatively, clean jars and lids thoroughly in hot soapy water. Rinse by pouring boiling water over them. Prepare for filling by placing clean jars and lids in a baking pan and heat in oven (100\u00b0C/212\u00b0F) until required.",
            "If Saskatoon berries are unavailable replace with blueberries. Blueberries will yield 750 ml of jam due to the difference in density of the berries.",
            "Prior to serving, add fresh lemon zest to the jam pot (fully incorporate) to enhance the berry flavour and brighten the taste experience.",
            "Yield: there will be a scant 700 mL so two 250 mL containers and then one to use right away that will not be quite full."

When provided by Tenderflake\u00ae with the recipe on the side of the box, it became the Canadian pastry baking standard and claim to fame as even to this day Americans cross the border with Tenderflake\u00ae lard on their grocery lists.",

            "The amount of whisked liquid used is determined by temperature and humidity. In summer, less whisked liquid will be required per batch, whereas in winter, more whisked liquid will be required for the dough to cling together. We recommend starting with 80 g whisked liquid per batch and adding more (maximum of 120 g per batch), and only as needed to obtain a crumbly but workable dough.",
            "Rolling pastry dough on a dough mat or parchment paper makes for easy clean up. Use a cover or sleeve on your rolling pin to avoid sticking.",
            "Unbaked pie pastry freezes well and can be frozen for up to 6 months. Place individually wrapped pastry discs in freezer bags and freeze. Thaw in fridge the night prior to using and roll each portion on a lightly floured surface: if dough is sticky, chill until firm enough to handle. Transfer rolled pastry dough to pie plate; trim and flute shells or crusts and bake according to your pie recipe.",
            "Traditional Canadian pie pastry is used for sweet or savory pies made from very cold lard and is famous for its crisp and flakey texture. This much sought-after quality is obtained with ice-cold lard and minimal handling as overworking will make it tough.",
            "Replace 227 g lard with 227 g butter for a tasty alternative."

            "For baking over an open fire, find a 5 cm/2 in. diameter wood stick, remove about 25.5 cm/10 in. of the inner and outer bark at one end, hold that end over the fire until it\u2019s hot but not burnt. Take a piece of dough and roll it with your hands (adding some flour if it is too sticky) to form a rope and wrap it around the bare end of the stick. Hold the stick wrapped with Bannock over coals, turning until golden, about 10 minutes.",
            "Bannock is often fried in small batches in skillet with a little oil: In a large frying pan on high, heat 5 cm/ 2 in. of oil. As soon as the piece of dough is dropped into the hot oil, turn it 3 times so that it puffs up evenly. Repeat with several pieces at a time and fry until golden brown for 3 minutes on each side until all the dough has been fried."

Valrhona is a high-quality couverture chocolate. Couverture is the name given to a certain class of high-quality chocolate. Couverture chocolate, unlike regular chocolate, is ground to a finer texture during the production process and contains a greater percentage of cocoa butter relative to the other ingredients. These two differences produce a superior flavour and texture that makes couverture the preferred chocolate for tempering and enrobing truffles, bonbons, and other fine candies.",

Valrhona is a high-quality couverture chocolate. Couverture is the name given to a certain class of high-quality chocolate. Couverture chocolate, unlike regular chocolate, is ground to a finer texture during the production process and contains a greater percentage of cocoa butter relative to the other ingredients. These two differences produce a superior flavour and texture that makes couverture the preferred chocolate for tempering and enrobing truffles, bonbons, and other fine candies.",
