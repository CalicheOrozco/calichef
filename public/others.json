He tried to patent the recipe in 1981, but it's been copied and developed by countless famous chefs over the years, including Jean-George Vongerichten (who also claims it as his own), Raymond Blanc and Gordon Ramsay. This recipe borrows from the classic, with a little Nigella inspiration too.",

Roll up lengthways. - For a donut: half the log lengthways, leaving one extremity uncut. Plait so that the cut is facing upwards then join both extremities to form the donut.",
            "The dip: the cheese sauce goes well also with grilled meats and potatoes.",
            "The risotto: risotto is best served immediately. Should you need to reheat it, you can do so in a pan, add a little water to it before reheating. Adjust cooking time according to the time indicated on rice packet. Liquid absorption may vary according to the type of rice. If risotto seems dry before it is cooked through, add more liquid.Rule of thumb for creating your own risotto recipe: for every 100 g risotto rice you will need 275 g liquids (water and wine) combined with stock paste. The maximum quantity of rice that can be cooked at any one time for this basic recipe is 500 g. Bear in mind adding other ingredients (e.g. mushrooms, sausage) will increase the volume of the overall dish. Please adjust the quantity of rice accordingly."

Now remove each wing by making a cut in the breast near to the wing, this piece of breast meat will keep the wings together. Now remove the breast - cut along the side of the breast bone and cut down keeping as close to the bone as you can. It is easier to make long slicing movements here, and you will not leave as much meat on the bone. Now remove the \u2018oysters', two small pieces of meat on the backside, just alongside the backbone.",
